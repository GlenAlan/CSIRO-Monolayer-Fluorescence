Format: some projects are well suited to keeping a lab book, either physical or electronic, which records all your daily tasks, recorded values, results, plots, thoughts, useful numbers, etc. For other projects, this documentation may come in a different form, e.g. organised notes or minutes from project meetings, GitHub commit records, or progress reports.

Whatever form you and your supervisor think is appropriate, your project documentation should:
- Include a project plan formed during the first few weeks of the project. This should include key milestones and dates.
- Be legible and clearly laid out, with dates against every entry/contribution.
- Include regular entries or updates. Most projects will make weekly progress, and so should have weekly updates to the documentation collection.
