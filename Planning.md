Goal: Find fluorescent monolayers through communication of the light and stage with Python.
- Create a coordinate system
- Take images at regular intervals then either:
  - Stitch image together and find monolayers by coordinates/position.
  - Locate monolayers in each photo and find coordinates based on image location and monolayer location within image.

Stretch goal: Create an algorithm to identify location and size of monolayers automatically.
- Use algorithm to identify location of monolayers based off image system.
- Use algorithm to calculate area.
